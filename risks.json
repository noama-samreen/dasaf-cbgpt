List the top 3 mining pools with their network hash from the https://miningpoolstats.stream/. If it is a PoS blokchain, then go to its validators list in the block explorer and check if any single entity owns more than 2/3 of the validators. List the top 3 validators as seen on the block explorer with their staked amount (if available). What to look for: Understand the consensus mechanism of the network. If it's proof of stake network that implements a ⅔ BFT threshold for validators voting on the next block (e.g. Tendermint, HotStuff, etc.), make sure no single entity owns 2/3rds or more of the validators If it's a proof of work network, make sure no single mining company/pool or entity owns more than 51% of the hash power. Other less popular ones include Proof of Authority, Proof of Space, Burn, etc. It's important to understand what is required to for the network to reach consensus/finalize a block, and reverse engineer how that can be accomplished and taken over. This information needs to be found on the network's official validator explorer (ex: Provenance) or other reliable source Make sure that you can tell the validators are owned by different entities. Sometimes they don't have this information so we will need to ask the issuer."

Sometimes projects may say they implement 'off-chain' governance, in which case we need to verify if it's decentralized. Sometimes the voting process to meet quorum to pass proposals might require math to calculate if an actor with enough money can overtake governance."

Dev docs, Whitepaper, Governance for Superuser State halting mechanisms. Most likely there won't be a 'red-button' that a superuser can push to take the whole chain offline. It will most likely be a coordinated effort between all the validators via a governance mechanism or planned software upgrade.

Describe requirements to become a validator or equivalent participant. 3. Calculate the minimum attack cost using the appropriate formula: - Proof of Stake (PoS): Ca = Ts × (Ct1 - Ct); Ac = Ca × Av; where Ct1 = 1.0, Ct = 0.67 (for 2/3 BFT), Ts = Total stake, Av = asset price per token. - Proof of Work or Proof of Resource (PoW): Ca = Te × (Ct1 - Ct); Bc = Ca × Rc × Bt; Ac = Cc × Bc; where Ct1 = 1.0, Ct = 0.49 (for 51% attack), Te = total hashrate or resource, Rc = cost per unit per second, Bt = block time (s), Cc = coinbase confirmation blocks (default 10). - If validator access is KYC-restricted, ignore KYC but still calculate attack path assuming open access. 4. Use data from public sources like: NiceHash (https://www.nicehash.com/algorithm) for PoW resource rental cost (Rc); CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap for Av (asset value); Official explorers or staking dashboards for Ts or Te. 5. Final output should include: Consensus mechanism; Validator entry requirements; Attack cost (Ac) in USD; Result: PASS if Ac > $5 million, FAIL if ≤ $5 million."
